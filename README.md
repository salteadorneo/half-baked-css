# Half Baked CSS

A joke stylesheet that \"covers\" half of any website with a band, so you can proudly say: \"This site is half-baked!\"

## Use

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/salteadorneo/half-baked-css@main/style.css">
```

Or download the `style.css` file and host it yourself.
